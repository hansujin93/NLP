@VirtualChrisB How many have replied-all saying don‚Äôt reply-all?
Ugh! Editing lecture recordings is excruciating. So, I say so every slide! I know I do this, but I can‚Äôt stop it. So I don‚Äôt sound like that, really, right? So...
@panthonysamy @SylFrey Congratulations to you both! :)
Thanks to all who have done this. Could do with just a few more, so if you have 10-15 mins to spare on a Friday evening or over the weekend, please take a look. https://t.co/aeEMOFHicC
Having a day off to take the kids to the circus tomorrow. So should be a pretty standard day!
@barneyc Me too! "Interesting" approach.
@perayson @SCC_Lancaster 731, 2020 is a leap year! :)
Would appreciate if you could help out my MSc. student with a survey detecting genuine and non-genuine emails. Should take about 10-15 minutes. https://t.co/HQ3e951yxp
@_paulbaker_ @Karrie_Don @elenasemino Congrats Karen!
@yelkhatib Brexit?
@perayson I‚Äôm considering just putting it in my signature.
Decided to split my Twitter into work and home. So this account will just be about my work in academia: #NLProc, #CyberSecurity, #corpuslinguistics, #CompSci, #DataSci. If you want to read about my other random ramblings, you can follow @al586.
@StevenHouben Todoist works well for me.
@DrClaireH Cat litter is a great shout, wish I thought of that. A roll of kitchen roll did it. Had to take all the kick boards off, got under all of them. Soup was good tho!
Free asparagus soup, just need to bring a straw. https://t.co/L3ZROpO16S
@timgrant123 @DrClaireH That‚Äôs just called ‚Äúsoftware development‚Äù.
@liedra Can you download the archive of all your tweets, and then script deleting them via the API?
Students aren‚Äôt consumers and universities aren‚Äôt a market. At least they shouldn‚Äôt be. https://t.co/ottDxpH7kF
Please tell me @ucu are not going to accept that offer? It‚Äôs actually insulting. I‚Äôm disappointed it‚Äôs even being put forward with any seriousness. @LancasterUCU. #NoCapitulation
Watching @UniversitiesUK Twitter feed with interest this evening, either been hacked, or they‚Äôre representing the insanity of the academic sector more closely now.
I really hope there‚Äôs some mistake in those calculations: https://t.co/omOQxJmcmI.
I should be teaching MSc students all about using NLP and machine learning for authorship analysis today. Instead, the marketisation of Universities and the greed of others has me striking and seriously considering whether a future in academia is worth it? #StrikeForUSS
In case you missed it @perayson. :) https://t.co/uUnDXUmVgg
@catterallwhite Didn‚Äôt he say himself he was knackered? First game in weeks on sat, was never gonna start tonight. We still need to sign another striker when Hugill goes tho, but not necessarily the same type of player.
@DrClaireH Made my foot in the wrong shape trying to play football, had surgery to try to put it back in the right shape. Can‚Äôt drive for 2 months, joy! Hope you‚Äôre doing well?
@yelkhatib I think that‚Äôs what they call ‚Äúchangeable‚Äù.
@blogpreston @blogpreston does anybody know when that part is now going to be built? Or indeed if it actually will be built?
@blogpreston Crazy that they didn‚Äôt build the road to eastway from new Durton lane roundabout at the same time. That would take a lot of traffic completely away from Broughton roundabout.
Out of action at the mo. Just had some metal put in my foot. Pain and the pain killers not agreeing with me! Hoping to come back with special powers.
@catterallwhite What you eat is important, but a war?
@lancspsychres @LaraWarmelink Congrats @LaraWarmelink
@lovermob @j_culpeper @TonyMcEnery Congtats! :) a very merry Christmas!
@marcgalexander That is the trouble with trinkets. (That was Apple‚Äôs autocorrect fail). Happy to fix it for them if they double my salary and let me work remotely.
@marcgalexander I reckon he‚Äôs Voq but doesn‚Äôt know it. Or it could all just be misdirection. I kinda hope he isn‚Äôt because I like his character.
@marcgalexander Same here, I hope the series doesn‚Äôt end on such a cliff hanger though. Ash is Voq, surely, right?
@marcgalexander I hope your ‚Äúmirrors‚Äù relates to this also. Multi-level.
@marcgalexander Not sure how you‚Äôd get them down a big hole either!
@marcgalexander You could just turn your internet off. ;)

@marcgalexander @UofGlasgow @UofGArts Fantastic. Congratulations.
@Budgierustler34 Grezza, choo choo choo.
@geoffjentry @StarTrekNetflix It‚Äôs on Netflix outside US. Bit daft that it isn‚Äôt in the US.
@StarTrekNetflix Yep, it was awesome. Series getting better with each episode, and more ‚ÄúStar Trek‚Äù. A lot of strange hatred of the show out there.
And to bring my last 2 tweets together: https://t.co/yv1VpZE5QG  I have done some work today too, promise.
Looking forward to watching new episode of Star Trek Discovery tonight (@StarTrekNetflix). Enjoyed so far, and heard this is best ep. yet.
New album, Instant Pleasures, by Shed Seven is excellent https://t.co/T2hkKnjpMB #NowPlaying
@congabonga I read the abstract first to make sure it‚Äôs relevant and of interest. But then again, I‚Äôm interested in ways of doing academia ‚Äúwrong‚Äù!
Clearly focused on the job today. Got all the way to work without the one thing I need, my laptop. Oh and a brain, will need to find that.
Great week off with the family. Kids up to 4 and 2 now. No more babies at home. Back for week 1 tomorrow. Bring it.

@muranava Hi, I‚Äôm hoping by the end of the Summer (so Septemberish), but depends on a few things.
@catterallwhite Boring kit if true.
@catterallwhite You might be right. Wouldn't want to taint his hero status. Uwe Rosler or Alex Neil would be good too.
@catterallwhite He ain‚Äôt gone yet, he might turn them down! If not, I‚Äôd get Grezza. I‚Äôd take Moyes, but can‚Äôt see it.
@crowe286 Knock yourself out mate! Literally. Good insomnia cure.
@catterallwhite Just got mine too. Another rollercoaster year no doubt.
My PhD thesis is finally available online, some 6 years later: https://t.co/J4LdjCTyDm #vard #spellingvariation #emode
@catterallwhite Get in first. Who are they?
@catterallwhite @baysidepne What‚Äôs the point on being on a planning committee when you‚Äôd rather have a wasteland?
@baysidepne Apparently 4v3, with one abstaining! üôÑ
@pnefc Strong statement from @pnefc‚Äú: Whatever we ultimately achieve will be without the support of @prestoncouncil‚Äù.
@baysidepne Specifics of training ground approved, but outline rejected. Can‚Äôt have training ground without outline approval.
More backward thinking from @prestoncouncil. I hope the local nimbys enjoy their ‚Äúgreen space‚Äù waste land.
@DrClaireH Congrats! Well deserved.
Work harder, make it better, do it faster, ‚Äúmakes us stronger‚Äù ‚Ä¶ our work is never over. #academiclife by #daftpunk

@catterallwhite have you got a video feed?
@catterallwhite with Google Chrome?
@catterallwhite "Select new seats" on the page after "Choose seats"
@catterallwhite I think so. Don't select any of your allocated tickets, and click the button that says "Choose different seats" or similar.
@catterallwhite Worked for me after a bit of persistence. You have to wait a while for the page to load. Also, use Chrome.
#pnefc did a lot better in their derby than #nffc @perayson! Confident for Wednesday? :)

Anyone know what North End players have at the top of their necks? Some sort of shock device if they go past the halfway line? #pnefc
Can Hugill only score when you blast it and bounce off him? How's he missed that? #pnefc
Managed to get the local pub for local people to put the game on. #pnefc #onholiday

üé∂ up down turn around, please don't let me hit the ground.
@catterallwhite winter break would help the national game you'd think. Hopefully it's combined with more distribution from PL.
@catterallwhite The b-teams thing is a separate argument. Shouldn't argue against based on what might be. Plenty of non-league teams could.
@catterallwhite I don't really see what the big issue is. As long as teams are from conference, and not b-teams, I'd be quite happy with it.

Pretty angry this morning. I've not slept, watching this horror unfold. Sick of my parent's generation crapping all over our's and my kids'.
@catterallwhite "keep calm and vote leave". The irony.
@catterallwhite You've been campaigning for voteleave for weeks, don't try and back out now. It's too late!
@catterallwhite You've been completely duped mate. Let me know when you realise that.

More of Lancashire voting to leave. Don't think I've ever felt so distant from my neighbours! #euref
How close does it have to be for there to be a recount? #euref
All of Lancashire is coming in as Leave. Hoping that Preston is "Urban" enough to go like Liverpool. #euref
@mariamaboelezz It'll be close I think, but I fear the worse.
Blackpool and Burnley unsurprisingly vote the wrong way. Sadly, I fear Preston will do the same.
I've been trying to finish a proposal all day, and night. Needless to say it isn't going well! Worrying UK future is a bit of a distraction!
@catterallwhite getting angry about things that aren't real, sounds about right for the vote leave campaign!

@heatherfro just train it to normalise naive -&gt; na√Øve, and/or add na√Øve to word list (instead of naive). VARD is na√Øve unless trained!
@heatherfro err, how? With the same training setup you should get exactly the same results, because algorithms. :)
Blackpool back where they belong. No sympathy after them revelling in our relegation a few years back. #pnecrisis

@heatherfro had major problems with LaTeX and R after update. Fixable, but a pain nonetheless, especially when you need them for a deadline!
Never updating Mac again, LaTeX and R both screwed just in time for a paper deadline. In a related moan, is the Xcode installer a sick joke?

@catterallwhite of the 3 defenders, to drop Wright is strange. Kilkenny should haven been dropped instead of Welsh. Good to see Browne in.
@Gareth_Tyson lecturer on grade 6!?
@deidrereads and I hope living in VARD wasn't too traumatic! Living in the source code for it is worse! :)
@deidrereads feedback is very welcome, and development ongoing when I find time. We're starting a crowd  sourcing VARDing EEBO soon...
@deidrereads I've just seen all your blog posts! I've got some reading to do when I get back from holiday! :)
@deidrereads a lot of these are due to VARD's default list which I'm currently fixing, if anyone has any lists of mistakes pls email me :)
@heatherfro What about the ethical consideration of using such data, especially if illegally sourced.

@perayson excellent! Do you get a bigger chair to do all the reading?
@heatherfro @pfs is that documentation for public consumption now? It's very handy! :)
@hardieresearch @heatherfro @pfs Hi, yes it was me! I figured it out myself in the end, by finding the documentation mentioned.
@catterallwhite good to have you with the best people. Which block are you in?
@leponline is posting that image, especially at lunchtime, really necessary?
@catterallwhite oh how the tables have turned! Bloody students ;)
@pnefc The club had the opportunity to do something innovative to ride the wave from the playoffs. These prices will stop that dead.

@number10gov @crossrail are only #workingpeople allowed to use it then? Sure you don't want to limit it to just #hardworkingpeople ?
‚Ä¶ ah figured it out. They are conversions from the SGML with &amp;‚Ä¶;, e.g. "&amp;etc;" -&gt; "{etc}" and "&amp;abper;" -&gt; {per}
‚Ä¶ looking at the actual EEBO images, I think {} represents some sort of shorthand mark that has been interpreted to the letters in {} ???

@catterallwhite I'd be worried if they were tweeting during training!
@catterallwhite Well either somebody at the club (or ex) is involved, or it's very badly worded.
@earlymodatLancs 1 revision lecture next week vs 13 hours this week. I'll take it! :)
Can I do some research now? #endofterm @AcademicsSay
@greenwop well yes. I'd be more worried about any other info they hold on you (if any).
@greenwop exactly! Wouldn't trust their security.
@greenwop I would hope they're storing a salted hash of your password, so the length of pw wouldn't effect the DB field!
@greenwop No, we are to avoid playoffs at all costs! If we're not gonna gonna finish top 2 now, would rather we finished 7th (not really)
@greenwop Haha! Don't think League One playoffs 2015 have been announced yet. ;)
@panthonysamy if it is I won't have time to tweet!
@panthonysamy I'm on my way now. Been teaching.
@Gareth_Tyson that's only 3.
Just heard about Sir Tom Finney's passing, very sad news. A true legend and great man. http://t.co/zQgn2T0Pu5
PhD studentships available @LancasterUni. I'm seeking to supervise research applying NLP to cyber security issues. http://t.co/NdWOsro9XF
Start teaching a 2nd year course today that I was a student on 10 years ago. If you'd have told me that then, I'd have laughed in your face!
@heatherfro I always presumed the answer was yes, but happy to be told otherwise!
@danjamker I enjoyed the talk, very interesting and really nice work.
@perayson 28 shots to 6. Unfortunately all that counts is 0-2.
@perayson robbed!
@yelkhatib @gareth_tyson Twitter will never be the same again‚Ä¶
re previous RT, problem is, a lot in the UK think this is a good thing!
@BBCLancashire and to top it off they blocked the building of a multi-storey car park at the hospital which would have alleviated the issue.
@BBCLancashire lives are being ruined!? I've seen them calling the police to cancer patients who couldn't find a space on the main site!
Just got a 9 on countdown that dictionary corner didn't get, finally a success in life! (It may have been 8 out of 10 cats does countdown).
@perayson I think it was more you keeping us out at the end!
‚Äú@pnefc: FT Nottm Forest 0-0 PNE.‚Äù Take that! Looking forward to the replay @perayson
@BBCLancashire @catterallwhite thanks for the answer. Hopefully we'll not have moved onto something else when you get round to it! :)
@BBCLancashire @catterallwhite they do realise it's 2014!??
@catterallwhite @BBCLancashire well that's useless, may as well carry the radio around.
Just said @BBCLancashire you could listen online from bbc sport site, can't see link though, anyone?
@catterallwhite if you're not living on the edge, you're taking up too much room.
@greenwop we're not very good in the playoffs.
@greenwop Yep, a real money earner for the Oystons that, congrats!
@greenwop Will enjoy the ride all the same. A relegation dogfight is never enjoyable. 1-0 btw.
@greenwop I'd take getting to the playoffs again over relegation. Anyway, Grayson managed to get your lot promoted, should be easy with us.
@greenwop Yep, we have a long list that can come in and continue Ince's fine work.
@greenwop There's a great manager at Stevenage, I'd recommend going for him. Or what about Paul Simpson?
:( He was doing a great job! ‚Äú@BBCSport: Blackpool manager Paul Ince has been sacked, along with his assistants Alex Rae and Steve Thompson‚Äù
I'm sure @mjbaron11 will be delighted that PNE v Sheff Utd has been moved to her birthday. :)
@catterallwhite sure there must be a footy game on somewhere we can watch.
Hannah's snoring keeping me awake. I suppose at least she's sleeping! She spent 9:30pm-11pm shouting very excitedly at us.
@richmounsey priceless.
@richmounsey oh well, boo is all I have. You could try gulping water with your fingers in your ears.
@richmounsey did it work?
@richmounsey BOOOO!!
@greenwop cruelty doesn't begin to cover it.
Interesting blog on textual analysis of EEBO texts by Stephen Wittek: http://t.co/POSVqXhVdk
@WatchedPotts woot. Congratulations! :)
@panthonysamy just finishing, answering questions.
@panthonysamy he was sat behind me when I got that, hope  he's not easily offended! ;)  he's just started talking now.
Uh oh, the wife (@mjbaron11) is on Twitter, best behave myself.
Hannah just slept through a smoke alarm going off over her head, didn't even flinch. Impressive, though a bit worrying!
@mrowebot ha, I think a kitten and a baby is enough for this year. I've got a few injuries for next week, so you might catch up. :)
@mrowebot haha! Now the distraction of a newborn has gone I will inevitably romp away with victory. ;)
‚Äú@panthonysamy: @mrowebot Great talk :) Finally, found out what you do! ;)‚Äù ditto :) very much enjoyed your talk.
Waking up and checking how bad @ECB_cricket have done is becoming a regular occurrence. 3rd 500-run 4th innings run chase in a row. #Ashes

GCHQ funded PhD studentship to come and work with me developing NLP tools for detecting social engineering attacks: http://t.co/QzeBZlN3bU
@greenwop normally by results, e.g. Preston 1-0 Blackpool.
@greenwop dunno what video you've seen, but in the one I've seen the offender blatantly runs out from your stand.
@greenwop No, there hasn't been any lashers running on and pushing them into horses.
@greenwop Dunno. Will you have enough players for your game? How many have you suspended now? #impeccable
@greenwop You've lost me! We got more away fans in League 1 than you do in the Championship. Should we get the discipline table out?
@greenwop ?? as in we don't travel away? err... http://t.co/BnM0Qzgof0
Pretty sure @pnefc couldn't have got a worse draw!
Good piece in the Guardian last week about the REF's problems with interdisciplinary research: http://t.co/v70zPqNHlh
‚Äú@BBCLancashire: [...] Blackpool boss Paul Ince has told his team to stop moaning and arguing with match officials.‚Äù Just , wow! #impeccable
‚Äú@greenwop: Don't let Paul Ince anywhere near the referee. #bfc‚Äù #impeccable
@greenwop Ha, that's quite good, for you.
@Budgierustler34 Beavon for me, been the better player this season.
I reckon 10% of all @leponline articles are about the Broughton bypass, 10% more are about the bus station.
@catterallwhite Make your mind up!
Haha! It had to be Garner to score! Brilliant.
GCHQ funded PhD studentship to work in @LancsUniSecure on using NLP methods to combat social engineering attacks: http://t.co/QzeBZlN3bU
@WatchedPotts How anybody can write a thesis without latex and bibtex is beyond me! :)
@panthonysamy Jeez! I best get started with mine! ;)
@danjamker Used to be my office :( wonderful view!
@marcgalexander sounds like an interesting party!
@willsimm *upto (I seem to have brought my dad's typing fingers today).
@willsimm I wish my baking skills were unto this standard! (although the mother-in-law's is up there). No from alex square. Go get some!
A cup of tea and a massive piece of flapjack makes it all ok. #flapjackthursday http://t.co/OXpphEABAM
@panthonysamy I thought it was a different conference!! :) don't have time at the mo, being academic staff has its downfalls.
@panthonysamy no, don't think so. Are you?
Oh, if only their corpus was varded! ‚Äú@heatherfro: Revising the @OED entry for potato salad http://t.co/1nOJ4VcmTZ‚Äù
@acepor @perayson 18%, doing the maths! :)
@catterallwhite Ha! I didn't cheat, I put the wrong answer to the last question.
I'm 97% NORTHERN according to the #northometer! That's somewhere around Middlesbrough. http://t.co/YPKolX1ECn - I made a mistake first time!
I'm 82% NORTHERN according to the #northometer! That's somewhere around York. http://t.co/YPKolX1ECn  How's @perayson more northern than me?
@HardieResearch Sounds like most of my days!
@catterallwhite More importantly, are you on tomorrow and are we having a drink beforehand?
@catterallwhite I don't see why it's so unlikely? He needs game, we're only a division below, he lives locally, likes the club, makes sense.
@lovermob maybe @ucrelcrs should apply for funding to provide flapjack for all attendees. ;)  #FlapjackThursday
@lovermob thank goodness for that. I missed last week, so I'll be buying 3. Only fair. #FlapjackThursday
Made better as now watching a presentation by the great Geoffrey Leech.
Day ruined by no Mr. Flapjack on Alex. Square. #NoFlapjackThursday @lovermob
@BenDavies1108 Hope this helps. http://t.co/e2SUlp3xA6
@acepor I haven't yet no, I will do in the near future though. Thanks.
@acepor Terrible for historical English too. Get in touch, I'm working on developing VARD (http://t.co/TMFUvyAVR6) to work for online text.
I wonder if anybody else has ever had to look up the lyrics to Culture Club - Karma Chameleon as part of their research.
@greenwop Ha, she started crying soon after, now enjoying the sleepy time.
So Hannah smiling at me is now my favourite thing in the world.
Thanks for uninstalling JRE #mavericks, was great finding out when I'm offline all day and need it for work.
Where I work: ‚Äú@DocElhaj: An amazing aerial view video of InfoLab21. http://t.co/R3zDroqhUB #InfoLab21 #LancasterUni‚Äù

Presenting a psychology department seminar this afternoon. Does not compute.
@catterallwhite Yes! Providing I can get out of work in time.
@lovermob Which one are you going to eat?
@BBCSport @DavidBondBBC now a non-story about a non-story. The British media really need to have a word with themselves.
Got the last piece of flapjack, @lovermob ate the rest! #FlapjackThursday
@lovermob Yes, me and him have had dealings in the past. #FlapjackThursday #boom
@lovermob Is that from the stall on alex sq.? If so, I'm all over it on the way to @ucrelcrs.

@mrowebot First stretch of motorway built in Britain, all to get around Preston.
Just overheard on the spine: "the good thing about Preston..." Missed the punchline. Feel free to add your own (@greenwop)
Just released another minor update of VARD, with a pesky bug fixed: http://t.co/tzmace7ALO
@perayson Maybe you'll start ageing backwards like Benjamin Button now.
@perayson Sure it wasn't 7, or 9 days? I'm confused just thinking about it.
@marcgalexander Thanks! She's only 3/4 weeks, so still at the cry,eat,sleep,repeat stage.
Is GW back in charge at #pnefc? Horrendous first half performance.
CHVRCHES debut is excellent, and the only bandname I know of that contains historical spelling variation. http://t.co/97f9A7Bn8H
‚Ä¶ and I really need to learn to look forward.
Might regret the previous RT. By 'eck I didn't realise I sounded *that* Northern!
First day back at work today. Would much rather be changing nappies, rocking Hannah to sleep, having a nap, etc., repeat....
@greenwop congratulations!! Hope you get more sleep in the next two weeks than I have in the last 2!
@greenwop is that a pudding or main course? Hope all is going ok.
@BBCLancashire a bit like a dog chasing cars. They wouldn't know what to do if they got it. http://t.co/DaCik3msgN
Right, that's enough of the laptop for one day. Might go and have a nap! :)
@TanjaSaily Thanks! Hope all is well with you. :)
@heatherfro Thanks Heather! :)
@WrightDW Thanks David. :)
@OxfordEEBOTCP Thanks. Hope the conference went well :)
@ojmason Thanks! :)
@mixosaurus Thanks Kat. :)
@_paulbaker_ Thanks Paul. :)
@WatchedPotts No, she still hasn't learnt basic logic, e.g. mummy and daddy need sleep to look after her.
@panthonysamy Thanks! :) Hope you're doing well, back in disco lab yet?
@_JohnHardy Thanks! :)
If you want to see pictures of our latest arrival, send me an email and I'll happily send some across. (not keen on putting them on here).
Found some pictures on the camera of Poppy when we first got her. Can't believe how small she was. http://t.co/f26o7vQKHn
@greenwop she's not been sick yet, don't want to encourage her.
How silly of me, I forgot all the important details. Hannah Jayne Baron born at 1:18pm on 12/9 at 8lb 6oz. Mummy and baby both doing well.
Would have liked to be at the #eebotcp conference today, but my 4 day old baby girl is keeping me hostage. Hope the conference goes well.
@richmounsey mit gas
Just released VARD 2.5.3. http://t.co/tzmace7ALO  A few more bug fixes and other improvements.
@perayson I don't think they found what they were looking for! The answer was "Alistair, Alister, Alastair, Alasdair, etc."
@catterallwhite should see you in there.
@catterallwhite aye! Which pub this time?
@catterallwhite Find a kind soul to build you one? Otherwise, not so sure anymore, everyone buys laptops. ebuyer maybe?
"lolz" Someone from the United Kingdom found "The extent of spelling..." on Google with the keyword: "alistair spelling variations"
Most productive day ever, despite it being transfer deadline day. Then again, being a North End fan means it probably wasn't very exciting..
@DrClaireH Thanks! :)
@AaronLavery Ha, some of the new ones give you change now, Preston's joining the 21st century slowly.
VARD 2.5.2 is now available, with some bug fixes and new options for automatic training: http://t.co/tzmace7ALO. Free for academic use.
VARD updates like Preston buses at the moment...
Ruddy hell, getting mixed up which is the cricket and which is the footy‚Ä¶ ‚Äú@pnefc: Goal, 4-4.‚Äù
YESSS‚Ä¶. ‚Äú@pnefc: GOAL!!!! 4-3 PNE!‚Äù
VARD 2.5.1 now available, featuring a new sampling interface and several bug fixes. More details at http://t.co/tzmace7ALO
@nicktaylor3 Once walked out of info lab in a similar situation, everybody stared! Easier just to burn.
If you've sent a request to download VARD recently, I've not been getting the email notifications, will reply to them all this evening.
VARD 2.5.1 includes a new feature which allows you to normalise a random sample of your text(s) to train VARD to auto-normalise the rest 2/3
VARD 2.5.1 is now available, I just can't get on the server to update the website to tell you about it until tomorrow. 1/3...

@DrClaireH :) she's not impressed today after frazzling her whiskers on a candle, picture to follow...
@greenwop Make the most of it, only 23 games left.
@greenwop More to bask in than you lot at the moment. Going down with Ince as manager.
What's Ince on about, by far the better side!? Nonsense!
@greenwop http://t.co/Nk7BBtJqWj here, you might need to buy some more straws to clutch at.
@greenwop beating you 1-0? They invaded the pitch at morecambe in the JPT too, not the brightest bunch.
@greenwop not that I support such things, never seen a bunch of kids run so fast when the horses came on.
@greenwop I think it was more because we beat the old enemy.
@greenwop Tom that is, hoping you keep Paul.
@greenwop hope you enjoy the championship whilst it lasts, if you lose Ince you're as good as down.
@greenwop hope you're having a good holiday!
@greenwop I should have known somebody from blackpool wouldn't understand a gentleman's game. (I'll actually probably just be watching rain)
@greenwop I might miss it if the cricket's still happening. Hopefully there'll be some clapsticks left when I get there.
@greenwop I know, it's a shame we couldn't find stronger opposition, but happy to show your lot the right way of things again.
@greenwop You going to the home of football tomorrow?
@richmounsey have you got a ticket for north end?
@richmounsey did Sean text you about tomorrow?
Much needed break starts tomorrow, first 5 days of which will be spent at Old Trafford for #theashes. Rain, rain, stay away...

@richmounsey it is required.

@mixosaurus it's glorious at the moment. Unfortunately p(weather today | weather yesterday) can't be defined.
@Jessica__Frye Brilliant, good to hear. Hopefully tomorrow's session on spelling variation will be just as enjoyable! :)
@Jessica__Frye Thanks :) Hope it was useful!
@richmounsey whiter than your trainers!
@WatchedPotts Excellent, seems you've got it covered. Going for a nap...
@WatchedPotts do you want to cover spelling variation too, I can have a nap then! ;)
@catterallwhite @sprungatom yep, and http://t.co/aVr14S48lt. Would be good to have one-online and both these on our own.
@sprungatom @catterallwhite Jim and Mart are the men for that. I'll talk to them about it and the server.
@sprungatom Fair enough. I have been thinking for a while of buying a server for pne-online and others, might need to bring that forward.
@sprungatom eek! Ok :) Maybe we'll have to finally get our own.
@greenwop based on knowledge from slides at that point, 2. would be h.t, but h.t on 3. would match hit, h t and hst. So h[aeiou]t instead
@catterallwhite I use Horse for webspace, not sure if he's still dishing out. For domain names, http://t.co/mudVaZT3V5 and fasthosts are ok

@thefrozensea thanks! :)
Just finishing off my prep for the advanced corpus queries and regex session @UCREL_Lancaster summer school tomorrow. http://t.co/YXTBtijEsr
@true_mxp Could be, I think it's been mentioned at #emda13 too. Many thanks for the mention. :)
Has somebody mentioned VARD? Just had a load of requests! ;)
@ojmason Agreed. How many times do they need to assess that I can do good research?
There must be a better way to dish out research funding. Imagine what we could do with all the time spent writing (inevitably rejected) bids
Oh Finny! You could have been a hero.
All work on hold, the cricket is too intense to concentrate on anything else...
In case you missed it yesterday, VARD 2.5 has now been released with plenty of improvements and new features: http://t.co/jW8xBoPct6
Finally! VARD 2.5 is now available. Loads of new features, and generally much nicer to use (IMHO). Details here: http://t.co/D2kFKrKM6t
@richmounsey Ha, you're alright thanks. You can come and have some any time though!
@richmounsey Nope! :) Fortunately I won't need to eat any as I made a big pot full of it yesterday.
@dr_heil Great, thanks, I'll have a look.
@dr_heil interesting, any publications you can link me to to read?
@heatherfro @dr_heil Ok, great, sounds interesting, thanks.
@heatherfro @dr_heil don't think so, but interested to hear about any research on OCR/spelling variation normalisation.
@heatherfro good good, keep spreading the word! :)
@heatherfro yes, and only 5 weeks late!
Here's one of Poppy watching me watching tennis whilst finishing off the VARD 2.5 userguide. http://t.co/Mxy1Tpxspd
Just realised I haven't put a cat picture up this week, I apologise for this oversight...
@_MelEvans Am sat watching tennis whilst writing the user guide for the new version! :) And no, I've heard varding, varded, even varder! :)
@catterallwhite Sleep? What's that then?
@catterallwhite good mate. 10 weeks to go! eek!!
@catterallwhite All that effort to press a little button, feel for you JK! ;)
@nicktaylor3 Congratulations! :) I hope you're going up soon to get some light whilst it's there! ;)
First up tomorrow morning at #CRESTx, presenting research into dealing with fake digital personas. http://t.co/R1Z1RqSqPe @CRESTxLancs
I think I've finally finished tinkering with VARD 2.5's UI. Hopefully released later today! :) http://t.co/gyiqg3SVjB
@catterallwhite na then mardy bum
Poppy had enough of attacking my arm, so went for my head. http://t.co/8cWUWNcxrf
@greenwop done on a spelling mistake, this is the worst day of my life...
@greenwop Only fair to let you pick the game. Have you sorted your pitch out, beech volleyball?
@greenwop A game of what? Tiddlywinks? Pin the tail on the donkey?
@greenwop are all your players in the photo there? Double cuppies?
Finally, eclipse showing no compile errors in the VARD code, 1st time for a week. Tomorrow is testing day, then it can finally be unleashed!
@richmounsey Say hello for me, I passed it yesterday.
Anybody want to be a beta tester of VARD 2.5, get in touch.
@catterallwhite best bloody not be! I'm at the ashes!
@catterallwhite @pnegrimsargh What about Bristol?
Today will be spent like the last week, getting VARD 2.5 ready for release. Made easier with the cricket being on, #wicket! #engvsa
@pnegrimsargh @catterallwhite Brentford would be my shout for what it's worth. Unless you did it in November (might be a bit chilly!)
@richmounsey Because it's all flattened down?
Wahoo! (Hopefully) All Swing-related issues fixed for VARD 2.5, now super fast, even with big files. Just a few features to finish.
@yelkhatib So true, I'm currently suffering from swing-related stress, might break something soon, and it won't be the code.
@richmounsey I think asda might sell beer mate.
@richmounsey Me: Do you wanna play footy tomorrow mate? @richmounsey:
Still working on finishing VARD 2.5. Current target is next Tuesday. Many improvements to the UI and functions, so hopefully worth the wait.
Instructions for getting through the day: Open iTunes, go to "Radio", Open "Classic Rock", Scroll down to "Powerage". Thanks me later.

@catterallwhite Are you not bothering then? If you're not, I'm not, as it will make life easier not taking it.

@wgi_19341 @watchedpotts I'd say it's important to know how much of an issue it is. You could look at a sample of concordance lines and ...
@WatchedPotts @wgi_19341 Depends on the noise. What type of text are you dealing with what is the nature of the noise?
@WatchedPotts Thanks!
Corpus linguistics people: Can anybody recommend a good introduction text to corpus linguistics methods for a History PhD student?
@catterallwhite Oh no! I'll have to check mine.
@Bleo1984 @catterallwhite I think I'll be meeting you guys there, gonna stay at a mate's in Chester.
@ojmason @tonymcenery @watchedpotts @hardieresearch I've had bacon buttes on barms - probably too often!
@pnefc @crewealexfc Will we all fit in the "Whitby Morrison Ice Cream Van Stand"?
@ojmason @watchedpotts @tonymcenery Bap, barm, bun, cob, bin lid - depends where you're from :)
Last chance today to submit an abstract for Corpus Analysis with Noise in the Signal workshop at CL2013: http://t.co/flZKRtzfs7
@mbleo That would make me sick every time I looked at it.
@ojmason Well, in my sample of 1, i.e. me, I have found that over time more papers are rejected or at least require major revisions.
@acepor Speak nicely to a journal editor? / be an interested journal editor?
I wonder if anybody has studied whether there is a correlation between age/experience of reviewers and acceptance rates?

@watchedpotts Congratulations on the RA post Amanda! :)
@perayson @drdavidcooper All cakes are dangerous if you buy 3.
Having seminars on Thursdays, the same day as the market in Alex Square., is dangerous‚Ä¶ More cake bought, very nice though. #yumcake
@greenwop It's ok, we're getting Grayson in apparently.
@mixosaurus congtatulations! ...and relax! :)
@heatherfro Cheers for the VARD mention, I wondered why I had so many requests today. :)
Patiently waiting to see if my cronjob's working so I can go home‚Ä¶
‚Äú@scottread16: Back from Deepdale. Graham Westley started by asking us a question today. #maverick‚Äù Was the question "What am I doing here?"
@BBCLancashire Has Graham Westley ever got through an interview without mentioning Stevenage?
@perayson @acepor Oh, and once a week!? Isn't the point to have it backup every hour? I just leave mine plugged in.
@perayson @acepor Mine started doing that, I got to the point where I had to delete the backup and start over again.
@catterallwhite How strange, has your account been hacked? Might be worth changing your p/w.
@catterallwhite How do you spell Twitter!? ;)
Thinking of setting up a UCREL CRS Twitter account for announcements, etc. Would people find that useful? http://t.co/CMXkeKfM

@acepor Only the first, 'come in handy'.
Just posted the 2nd CfP for Corpus Analysis with Noise in the Signal (CANS 2013) workshop at CL2013, Lancaster. http://t.co/00xT8RKr
Paul Connolly signed for #pnefc. Finally, we have a right back (presuming Westley doesn't play him up front or in goals).
@mjharwood1 I assure you, my dad has 100s of awful awful ties.
Actually managed to do some development of VARD today. New version not too far off‚Ä¶
@catterallwhite Are you joking!? I went to the pub last time in a happy mood, I nearly didn't go on the game after you'd finished with me ;)
@catterallwhite Not like you to have a moan John! ;)
@catterallwhite Everyone was moaning the other week that they don't say when players are injured. Damned if they do, damned if they don't!
@catterallwhite We needed a right back regardless.
@catterallwhite So not 100% then! ;)
@MintyPNE congrats mate!
@catterallwhite excellent news mate, pass on my best. And happy new year!
1st CfP for Corpus Analysis with Noise in the Signal (CANS 2013) workshop released today: http://t.co/00xT8RKr
@perayson I'm going to send you about 20 emails soon‚Ä¶ ;)
@mjharwood1 come to Manchester to watch the hives with me and @GuyMachin! X
@MintyPNE same here!
@catterallwhite disagree! Looks good to me.
@catterallwhite he played well last time he was there.
@catterallwhite Rumour earlier that it was Phil Orange, maybe Grezza is assistant? Would be sad to see him leave.
@greenwop he's our nutcase. Like hollowhead was yours.
@perayson interdisciplinary cutlery.
Notts County are a bunch of cheating thugs.
To whoever's put a jar of instant coffee in the B-Floor @InfoLab21 fridge, go home and get some sleep!
@mjharwood1 Did footy happen tonight? Did you play?
"Google Chrome would like to access your contacts". Err, why?
@perayson So far ok. Seems you have to install java though, strange‚Ä¶ doing so now.
About to upgrade to mountain lion‚Ä¶
Anybody know if there's cricket highlights on anywhere (not sky)? They don't seem to be on Channel 5. #IndvEng #cricket

@TanjaSaily Big problem because Twitter don't seem to be allowing people to redistribute collected tweets.
Great day/night. Had some very interesting conversations about future research and found out I'm a (great) uncle, again! :)
@perayson worse day to be a Blackpool fan!
@willsimm Thanks! :)
Eee by 'eck it's grim up north today I tell thee.
@mostlyahardie Feel free to just leave it, I can sort it out later. No problems.
@mostlyahardie oh and shpps is still being developed, so fine to leave that not working. I can sort it when you give permission to play!
@mostlyahardie great! Thanks! I wouldn't bother with spatialhum as it's being replaced with shpps and triadic as it's duplicated on stig.
@mostlyahardie D'oh!! I'm going offline for a few hours now, but let me know when/if you want me to have a look.
@mostlyahardie Take your time! I'm enjoying the excuse for not finishing off the work I need to do on there. :)
I think I'm coming down with lurgee. Great timing with my new research post officially starting tomorrow!
very cool ‚Äú@_JohnHardy: In my research you can create interactive displays anywhere as demonstrated in the @InfoLab21 http://t.co/rWdl1cmF‚Äù
@thefrozensea @heatherfro http://t.co/H3QcJsR6 is the best analysis to play with, email me if any questions / you want to add your own data.
@heatherfro @thefrozensea You can use VARD to do manual spelling normalisation too :) And you can use DICER to analyse the spelling trends!
@greenwop I'm sure they'll improve it eventually. Just don't understand why they've removed podcasts from iTunes.
@greenwop syncing doesn't work, no playlists, keeps deciding I've not listened to stuff when I just have. It doesn't "just work"
Thanks Apple for making it almost impossible for me to listen to podcasts on my iPhone. #IOS6
Wow! Updated Eclipse and have had no problems. Hopefully not spoke too soon.
@Rich94 very nice!
Seems I've missed a belter at Deepdale. 5-0 #PNEFC. Perfect response to Saturday's no show. Onwards and upwards.
Just back from #eebotcp2012. Excellent conference, thanks to all, especially @pipwillcox. Only downside is I'm missing #pnefc winning 2-0
@JukkaTee haha. I think I'll make a web version first. :)
@pipwillcox Strictly for corpus linguistics purposes, of course. :)
Excellent conference dinner in magnificent surroundings at #EEBOTCP2012. Looking forward to another great day of talks tomorrow.
You'd never see this much wine left at a corpus linguistics conference. Very civilised #EEBOTCP2012
Great panel on using EEBO-TCP for teaching at #EEBOTCP2012. Glad that students at Reading are interested in spelling modernisation!
Whoo, another mention of VARD at #EEBOTCP2012, thanks @heatherfro. Interesting talk on using WordHoard, Docuscope and LATtice.
@JukkaTee Let me know which editors scoff! I'll write a strongly worded letter. :)
@JukkaTee I'll try my best! There may be a bias to anything spelling related.
@helensonner But some letter replacements are much more common: http://t.co/iQCjYRej #EEBOTCP2012
@heatherfro Any particular language? I'll need to learn it over night!
Lots of talk about spelling variation so far at #EEBOTCP2012, my favourite subject! :)
Made it to #EEBOTCP2012. Listening to Rebecca Welzenbach talk about EEBO-TCP in 2012.
@catterallwhite The train didn't turn up! :)
Train fail in attempts to get to Oxford tonight for #EEBOTCP2012, hopefully I'll have better luck early tomorrow morning.
@catterallwhite will do.
@catterallwhite @hodsonick yep!
@catterallwhite @hodsonick if anyone's going for tickets please can you get me one??
@DrDavidCooper you'll be ok as long as you're not building a mobile app. It was a quote from a paper at the conference, don't think I agree.
@greenwop I was told today it was a mix between running man and battle royale. Got it to watch tomorrow night, so will see!
@perayson did you get back in time for Dr Who?
On a roll! ‚Äú@pnefc: Late drama at the end but Preston fully deserve the three points, their second league win on the bounce.‚Äù
Thoroughly enjoyed #dhcshef, thanks to all the organisers. Now for a visit to the devonshire cat!

@BBCLancashire Will it be online?
@catterallwhite Did you see my pops?
@liedra Happy Birthday! I can think of worse ways to spend it. :)
@catterallwhite Healy's signed!
@mjharwood1 stop getting Bond wrong!
@mjharwood1 Might be over this evening at this rate.
First goal of the season, Jack King. Onwards and upwards.
Yes!! The real who!
Awful closing ceremony. Opening ceremony showed all that was good about Britain, the closing ceremony showed the obsession with celebrity.
She's back! FFS.
The only way they can save this is having the stones finishing with satisfaction.
"it's all about the money". Good message.
Russell Brand!! No!!
@liedra Well I'll take another gold for GB, even if it goes to the horse!
@liedra Does the horse get the medal then? ;)
I can watch and enjoy most sports, but what on earth is this dressage? It's just a horse prancing around.
@perayson This: http://t.co/Fy4mb228 ?
PENDLETON, awesome!
@catterallwhite I expect you could mate. In fact, get your kids on the case, probably do a better job too.
@catterallwhite Me and Jim could produce a better website in a day. It's so amateurish.
@catterallwhite Do you know if they pay anything to a company, or is it paid centrally by the league?
A WICKET! #cricket
Opening ceremony so good even McCartney didn't ruin it. Should have had the Stones.
@mjharwood1 err. Credit please! X
Gotta say the opening ceremony's been absolutely brilliant. Danny Boyle's done us proud.
@mjharwood1 in fact you are now disowned for mentioning them both in the same tweet.
@mjharwood1 running man isn't dire in any shape or form. GUESS AGAIN.
@sprungatom Do it, working late so I'll listen along.
@NewspaperJoeUK Who would you have instead though? Bairstow's not ready imho.
#britishsummer ! Stop raining and leave the cricket alone! #ENGvSA
@MintyPNE Same here, only recognise a handful of the players
@MintyPNE Think he got injured in training last week.

@catterallwhite @baysidepne If paddy power paid him more, which they probably did, he needs a one match ban, otherwise everyone would do it.
@baysidepne @catterallwhite They should get fined more for racism, I agree with that but it doesn't make the punishment of bendtner wrong.
@catterallwhite Why? He knew exactly what he was doing, the lad's a tool.
@greenwop he blatantly meant it. I'd have done the same in the same position ;)
"women shouldn't be allowed to play football" by @mjharwood1. @bbeclrc
@yelkhatib why don't they just make 10 a bit louder?
Anybody know if Preston Sports Arena is open tomorrow?
@greenwop maybe he'll go to swansea with ollie.
@JukkaTee Sounds interesting! :)
finish processing already... I wanna go home!
Hmmm. Just bought OSX Lion. I might regret this.
@NeilMellor33 All the best Mells. You'll always be remembered for your goals against the Lashers.

@mjharwood1 is it Italian Job?
Possibly the worst performance I've seen from #pnefc. They say it gets worse before it gets better. Surely it can't get any worse!
@PortlandTimber It's the wife's birthday! ;)
#pnefc dreadful second half tonight. Horrendous tactics, players brought in simply not good enough. Westley's all talk.

Wahoo! 100% in final @dbclass exam! :D (I have done DB in my degree and use MySQL all the time, but there was quite a bit of new stuff too)
@sprungatom Cheers, all looks good now.
@sprungatom no worries mate. Cheers for sorting.
Peter Risdale!!?? Is this some kind of bad joke? #pnefc
Hey congrats @JukkaTee! I've just got home via Frankfurt. Should have jumped on a flight to Helsinki!!
And now there's been a fight. What is with this country?
UK transport system is a joke. The rest of Europe put us to shame.
@greenwop Shhh you, it's bad enough.
#pnefc 1-0 down already. Conceded from own corner.
@yelkhatib It doesn't really work like that!
@yelkhatib Lost all faith now I'm afraid, can't remember the last time we won.

@perayson I'm not sure you're ready for that.

@greenwop Good win for your lot. Looking forward to the return of football tomorrow.
First ball! Oh Jimmy Jimmy #EngvInd
enjoyed #cl2011, thanks to all involved.

@greenwop I've heard PB's been arrested for shooting Stelling.
@greenwop that is actually quite funny, I guess someone at Countdown is a lasher. You lot really should get over us though!
@greenwop I presume that's photoshopped?
Anyone any tips for what to use now instead of Skype?
@greenwop uh oh, not looking good. Gutted for you!
@perayson Confident??
@greenwop that's a poor effort, even for you.
@greenwop we'll be back. You'll always be lashers.
@greenwop yep. Sad, very sad. You lot never did have any class though. The correct order of things will be resumed soon enough.

@MintyPNE what about the referendum?
Just been to vote. You've got 20 minutes to do the same. You're not allowed to moan about how shit the country is unless you do.
@lonners1 They haven't decided how competitive they want to be next season. Worst interview I've heard, the man's a joke.
@ConorMcL10 and what do you think Conor?
@greenwop rather play in the bloody conference than be a lasher.
@sarabury Playing you next season, joy!
:'( relegated. Back to the drawing board #PNEFC
@greenwop who are they? ;)
Hmmm, as it stands, we're down!
@greenwop Yes please! The whole thing is very worrying, but still really cool to look at.
@greenwop How did you do the location resolution thing?
It just got interesting!!
New track by The Music: http://www.themusic.co.uk/ , is Hooky on bass?? Gutted they're splitting up. One of the best live bands going.
Meanwhile, what's happened to Forest @perayson? Out of the playoffs!

@perayson I never thought I'd see the day.
11 games to go, 13 points from safety. Err, I think we might just be down? I wonder if Brown will admit it?
FFS North End, you're shit.
@DarelRussell Why are you not in the squad Darel? We could do with your presence in midfield.
@nicktaylor3 Good point, you should reply to the list and voice your concerns. We've not had a good list bust-up for a while.
@nicktaylor3 What are you still doing on our mailing list? Deserters aren't welcome.
@mjharwood1 does living with someone make them best mate now? Mel hasn't watched it either. Maybe we can get them together... ....

All the best to @ConorMcL10. You'll get over this setback, great future ahead of you.
@greenwop we're down. But I reckon you could end up being too.
Where do we go from here? #pnefc. League 1 I'm afraid.
Ok lads. We really really really have to win today. #PNE
This week I have been mostly listening to Mumford & Sons, LCD Soundsystem, Noah and the Whale, Little Comets and The White Stripes.
Before every game, it's must win. Then we don't win. Next game, must win. Can't go on for much longer.
I know I'm pretty late, but absolutely loving the Mumford & Sons album.
@MintyPNE Haha! Luckily for you, I've already voted.
@MintyPNE isn't that against the rules? ;)
@sprungatom Ian Ashbee
Just realised that apple have sorted out the "feature" (bug) that started iTunes every time you pressed play. Pretty much made my day.

@ConorMcL10 Man of the match for me today Conor. Well done. Have you seen Nathan Ellington's tweet?
Get in... so close now! Never thought we'd do it tonight, so glad I stayed up. #Ashes
Absolutely loving listening to England win the #Ashes.
@ConorMcL10 what do you think of the new manager Conor? Congratulations on your breakthrough, great performances.
@MintyPNE haha!

@greenwop ok, that's a bit harsh. I hope you have a lovely day out, but are ultimately disappointed.
@greenwop No offence, but I hope you have an awful day tomorrow.
This day couldn't possibly be any worse.

@greenwop "last time" / "this season"... errr...

@greenwop Ha, dunno, I didn't stay around, should have been a lap of shame. There's only about 5 players I'd keep.
@greenwop The Mighty Seasiders are four wins away from the Premier League!  --- I feel sick!
@nicktaylor3 it's ok, all our office are racists too, although not first placed - you should be ashamed actually.

Don't get me wrong, I like formula 1. But why on earth do they have "live text" on the bbc website for "testing"?
@sarabury @nicktaylor3   can I just have my PhD in 'Slowness' and be done with it?
not going to meeting tomorrow. Derby, Forest and Scummers fan. Nightmare.
@nicktaylor3 there's a better option actually, scroll to the bottom of your inbox, and there's a link to "turn off buzz"
@nicktaylor3 Phew, thanks. My world is restored.
Where's my option to turn #googlebuzz off?
@T_S_U http://twitpic.com/11ye6o - we're so tired of sticking to your limits.
@specialized that bumptop is awesome, cheers.
@sarabury Sounds dangerous to me. Snowed in methinks.
How bad's the snow in Lancaster? Wondering whether to brave the trip.
Big Fat Quiz of the year = Epic Fail. Can't be doing with Woss and Bwand. Good job Smokey & The Bandit's on ITV 3.
AAGHGGGHHH!!! Just spilled Dandelion & Burdock on my macbook!! Seems ok, lucky escape.
Arctic Monkeys tonight, top banana.
You know you're getting old when your idea of anarchism is taking another supermarket's "bag for life" into another store.
@nicktaylor3 Mark Corrigan would.
@nicktaylor3 your tweets could so easily be those of Mark Corrigan.
@specialized yes please!!
Finally got around to watching "Micro Men". Did anyone else keep expecting Clive Sinclair to go on his intercom and order "Kill him!"

As is my spelling.
DH2010 abstract deadline Octoboer 31st. It's a horrorshow!
really really doesn't like freshers. Call me a miserable sod if you like.
how does my mac know the second display is above the screen automatically? That's quite impressive. If only they hadn't broken my remote.
Feels old, bloody freshers.
bloody freshers.
@nicktaylor3 on monopoly? new order this time.
is a little too excited that peep show starts again tonight.
@Monopolycitysts never mind 1st problem. I went back on and the money was back in my account. Great work by the way.
@Monopolycitysts: 2nd problem(?): It wouldn't let me spend my 3,000,000 exactly on 2 streets.
@Monopolycitysts 2 problems. First, I built a green house it took the money but didn't give me the building!
@greenwop we've only played 1 game against the top half! Can only beat what's put in front of us. How's that 3rd stand coming along?
@greenwop Please see league table.
@greenwop me too! T'other day. Means going to Blackpool though, shame! ;)
@nicktaylor3, or you could just get tickets for Blackpool on 13th December, where they will definitely turn up! :)
I'm either going mad, or I just saw a Dinosaur on Garstang Road.
is behind the times, and just seen Google Wave. WOW!
gotta love cricket, you get absolutely tonked and still get a draw. #ashes
@nicktaylor3 No, but I got a telling off on my way out.... What happens if one of your nostrils is blocked? Do you die when they swap? ;o)
To be fair they did send an email telling us not to!
felt a bit of an idiot walking out of the building after the fire alarm had been going off for 20 minutes!
2am on Lancaster Uni car park with a flat battery is not a place I'd like to be again.
Is back from USA, totally jet lagged!
just found out about ‚åò~, my mac's even better than I thought! Enjoying NYC, Macy's was crazy!!
enjoyed #dh09, thanks to the organisers and everyone else. In NYC now, arrived with a thunderstorm!
Finally submitted and joined Twitter. At #dh09
