@catterallwhite No way a pen.
@Johnnyproudlove I remember similar with Ben Davies.
@catterallwhite Still rough. Probably going to deepest darkest South Yorkshire wasnâ€™t the best idea!
@catterallwhite Glad it went ok John.
@perayson Milk 0, before 1 tea.
@catterallwhite Gonna be a long season!
Can anyone recommend someone to repair a dishwasher? (Preston area)
Weâ€™re not a one man team. If Maguire is out for a couple of months, weâ€™ll be fine. Donâ€™t panic! #pnefc

What on Earth was that! It was far too easy. Semi final!
@GaryLineker @BBCOne Spoiler alert!
@Sedds_lep No interviews needed after a training session. Get to the bar.
QF on BBC! Get in!
@catterallwhite Youâ€™ve just reminded me, got Prosecco in the fridge! Still waiting on the boy to go to sleep.
What time are bbc highlights on? 6am pick up tomorrow, oh well.
Unbelievable scenes! England have won a penalty shootout. Never in doubt, honest! ðŸ˜¯
@catterallwhite Awesome John! Well earned, well deserved.
Massive game in Group G. If it stays the same, I think I win worst team in the work sweepstake! #PANTUN
@catterallwhite Itâ€™s a ridiculous idea, better to have winning momentum.
Canâ€™t believe weâ€™re gonna win the World Cup!
