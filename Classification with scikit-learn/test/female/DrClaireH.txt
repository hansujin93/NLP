@mareberl Right?? This definitely feels like it's all about Trump himself, but in some sort of grandiose idealisation where he bestrides the earth and scorns the rest of us mere mortals.
That's right. We're just here, hanging out with MIT, UMass, UMD, Edinburgh, Harvard, Cambridge, Berkeley, Stanford, Oxford, UCLA, and HKU. Busy being all awesome and stuff.  What can I say.  LAEL is awesome. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  #GoDucks #loveLancaster https://t.co/3ncLazk51p

@mareberl This is wild. It‚Äôs like reading a split personality. I wonder how he conceives of ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù in his own head - as a brand? Some sort of demigod? A superhuman above all laws and responsibilities? It‚Äôs so weird!
Anyway, if we could all just slow down with the avalanche of threat/deception/manipulation data right now? That'd be awesome. I haven't yet had my fifth cup of coffee and it is raining data.

The magic goes on. It seems Matt Gaetz (@mattgaetz) tweeted at @MichaelCohen212:  "Do your wife &amp; father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she‚Äôll remain faithful when you‚Äôre in prison. She‚Äôs about to learn a lot‚Ä¶"
@mareberl Mmmm, I think you're right. Now I want to go count. Perhaps it seems extra disjointed here today because of the shift from "me" to "Trump". It's such an oddly dis-associative move to talk about yourself as if you're someone else.
Blimey. People who work in deception and manipulation and whatnot, you might want to read Michael Cohen's statement. It is... quite something...  "And so I lied about it, too ‚Äì because Mr. Trump had made clear to me, [...] that he wanted me to lie."  https://t.co/ls5mVk6903

I've said this in the past and I can't think of a single time I've used it where it's helped someone else with their worries.  I think I'm going to excise that phrase from my repertoire.
Weird insight of the day: on my way to lunch I heard someone tell an upset friend, "Don't worry about it!" and was struck quite forcibly by how this actually seemed to mean, "Stop worrying out loud/at me about it!" and nothing remotely approximating, "I'm hearing you". ‚òπÔ∏è

@AntiProfessor Apparently for twenty "average appetite" eaters, it's 7.5.  Unfortunately the clever food calculator can't tell me how many portions of curly fries or slices of garlic bread is equal to one pizza, so I'm still probably going to trigger a riot.
After a useful five minutes using the How Many Pizzas To Buy Calculator, I can only wonder how any of us survived into adulthood before the internet.  Seriously. I was going to order three 12" pizzas for twenty adults. That calculator has probably just averted a riot.
Oh wow, I am beyond envious! I hope you enjoy every second of them. In my "what I'd do if I were independently wealthy" daydream, I have at least another five degrees lined up, including criminology, law, computer coding, and psychology.  Also all CHs are just awesome.
Seriously‚Ä¶ how is this STILL a ‚Äúselling point‚Äù?!?  I am not remotely religious but if praying helps, I am begging you, universe, god, pastafarian noodly monster - end this madness. #BinBrexit https://t.co/x3rLrkCjxL

For anyone who really, REALLY wants to know the context of this tweet: https://t.co/RxNyJQpxbp  Is anyone out there doing lexicographic work on propaganda? I would buy that dictionary.
Just a heads-up that "racially-tinged remarks" is probably going to be the new "alternative facts".  Because apparently words like "racist" and "opinion" are hard.
I‚Äôm thinking we‚Äôre going to need to start defining troll subspecies‚Ä¶ Anyway, disinformation! Global politics!! Scandal!!! Forensic linguists might like this. https://t.co/Z2luZGk4O4
Okay so I realise this is somewhat beside the point, but those yellow-vest-wearing men who gang up and shout abuse at MPs and anyone who disagrees with them... What is it with their jeans never fitting right?
@adriandkelly @jk_rowling Heh. For a man who has such strong views on "snowflakes", he sure does get deeply upset and precious about savoury pastry snacks.
@adriandkelly @jk_rowling Honestly? I'm not sure. It was a cheese and chutney (and tears) toastie. The vegan sausage rolls were sold out or I would've definitely tried one.
@jk_rowling Oh god I have become That Person on Twitter who "WELL ACTUALLY"s people...  &lt;cries into Greggs toastie&gt;
@jk_rowling Uummm... it's a parody account. Sorry. :(
@elenasemino This somehow reminds me of that Charlottesville liberal protest incident where a neo-Nazi ran down and killed a woman and three Trump responded that there was blame on both sides, and there are fine people on both sides. I know it‚Äôs not an exact match, but still.
Simple basics EVERYONE deserves, every day, no matter who you are or where you came from or how you got here:  - Food - Shelter - Safety - Free education for life - Free healthcare for life - The same opportunities as everyone else  The end.  Why is this so hard.
Sidepoint: it's inconceivable that someone else hasn't already tweeted something to this effect, but I don't have time to go find whoever got there first and retweet them, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
It is indescribable - I mean that I feel physically ashamed, to the pit of my stomach - that any child in this country is going hungry. No adult should either, for that matter. I don't usually get too noisy about politics (okay, well, maybe I do) but this is contemptible.
So just to be clear, the Government has recently appointed a Minister for Loneliness and a Minister for Suicide and now there are calls for a Minister for Hunger...? Like, maybe, just MAAAAAYBE, this signals something? Government? Huh...?
Well, look at that. Today's to do list:  1) Panic-write this bid 2) Finish @_enclair bonus episode 3) Be reminded why I hate Skype so much 4) Drink a metric fuckton of coffee 5) Get tweet-quoted in The @IndianExpress  MY GOD I AM ON FIRE TODAY https://t.co/Ttm7xuK0PS

@DanSeanClayton @FORGE_LU Now you just need a swearomfg autocorrect and you‚Äôre there.
Final thought: when your joke has to have ‚Äújoke‚Äù at the very top, just in case, missing ligatures and badly primed punchlines are probably only the tip of the iceberg.
That seems to be the case here, thus, coffin medicine becomes #conmedicine.  Second reason this joke sucks: if the punchline is ‚Äúcoffin‚Äù, then you really don‚Äôt want ‚Äúcough‚Äù in the joke itself? It‚Äôd be better (loosely speaking) as, e.g.: ‚ÄúWhat does Dracula take for a cold?‚Äù 4/4
‚Ä¶the computer or font used to print the jokes seems not to have had. Sometimes when a computer/font lacks a character, it will render a square box or an odd character in its place so you know something‚Äôs missing. And sometimes it‚Äôll just skip it altogether. #conmedicine 3/4
To fix this, computers automagically replace clusters like ffl with a single glyph known as a ligature. Fun fact: the ffi ligature even has its own unicode entry (U+FB03). But, just because the computer used to write the jokes had the font with this glyph in it‚Ä¶ #conmedicine 2/4 https://t.co/k650cnwKur
Okay, a quick explanation for anyone who‚Äôs perplexed: the answer should read COFFIN MEDICINE. Alas, this joke sucks (pun intended) on two counts. First problem: when a computer writes letter-clusters like ffi or fl, the F‚Äôs crossbar makes the kerning a bit ugly‚Ä¶ #conmedicine 1/4

Looking at you @perayson - first on the scene with your digital detective skills. https://t.co/wHmwLoRVCl
Mkay, well, since the eagle-eyed amongst you have already spotted my attempted-top-secret creation of the social media behind the forensic linguistics podcast, I may as well just go ahead and advertise it properly: follow @_enclair or subscribe at https://t.co/oBSmm5fcDG.
@mareberl An analogy might be, "Is it still CSI if a non-CSI looks for fingerprints at a crime scene?" Well, I guess so. They're investigating a crime-scene, which, by definition, is CSI, but it's not worth much if they can't lift the prints and/or can't cross-ref them against a database.
For those working in forensic linguistics, these are scarily weak as examples, HOWEVER they're also literally the last point in a long list of other evidence, so they're not being used in isolation. IOW, they're just one small piece of a much larger picture of evidence.
Part of the US vs Cesar Altieri Sayoc criminal complaint cites the #MAGAbomber's online language:  a. Misspellings, e.g. ‚ÄúHilary‚Äù (Hillary), ‚ÄúShultz‚Äù (Schultz) also found on the bombs b. A post critical of, among others, Obama, Soros.  Full complaint: https://t.co/2ZyHPdBzzn https://t.co/MVqHQxsKYt
@mareberl So could you say it was FL? I guess you could? But it wouldn't be the sort of FL that anyone I know in the field would ever want to put their name to. At least, based on what we know of it from the complaint.
@mareberl Good question!  Short answer: depends on how puritan you are about FL.  Long answer: the criminal complaint cites Sayoc's language, which many would see as FL. BUT their examples suggest *extreme* simplicity (common typos; criticisms). This would be desperately poor FL at best.

@RjJagodzinski And I think the other (other, other, other) problem is the inference that this issue is somehow exclusive to this field. As if no other field is warped by political bias, social agendas, etc. I mean, fuck's sake, have they SEEN all those US gun studies? Oh, wait.
@mathewgillings @RjJagodzinski Yeah, that's another bit I'm dubious about. We shouldn't have to work from a bad-faith position in peer-reviewing. I don't assume that stuff I'm reviewing is a hoax, plagiarised, falsified, etc. BUT I do work from the position that I need to catch shit methods, dodgy data, etc.
@RjJagodzinski The ax-grinding about "real science" is also irritating. The subtext seems to be that the only One True Way is the hard science, quant is queen way. And yet, they're attacking the *humanities*.  But then the summaries of the papers they got accepted... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  So conflicted on this.
@RjJagodzinski The more I write this, the more I'm starting to think I should just write a blog-post on it so I can find out what my thoughts on the matter actually are.
@RjJagodzinski And I can't tell you how much the "grievance studies" name makes me cringe. What a way to hamstring your own argument right from the get-go.  Also I didn't mind the super-shoddy deception at the start, but when they started escalating the sophistication of it? Not cool.
@RjJagodzinski I've been thinking about this study on and off since I read it and I can't decide if it ill result in net good. Whatever the case, 99% of people are likely to stop after the first section because its tone is so sneery, so much of the substantive stuff later is going to be missed.
@RjJagodzinski In fairness, they do say it's not all bad, but then (a) refer to all the research as "it" and how bad "it" is, making no distinction for non-problematic research, and (b) amusingly, they support their expertise on the extent of the problem via... *drumroll*... anecdotal evidence.
@CorporAlex Absolutely. They try to address that (I‚Äôm sure you saw that bit) and it‚Äôs one of my several reservations, but I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs worse. This or doing nothing. I can‚Äôt readily think of a third solution, either.
@LaraWarmelink Very interesting, thanks!

@DrPicornell Oh Abe Lincoln tweeted me some kind words but I started to feel like sharing yet another president‚Äôs praise would just be showing off.
@WrightDW This has been a disturbingly, unintentionally insightful tweet. I even got a message from a *media outlet* about it (naming no names). When something this crazy can almost pass muster, it‚Äôs easy to see how malicious fake news is so successful.
@LaraWarmelink That‚Äôs what‚Äôs really remarkable about it. When given the choice of (a) a deceptive/satirical tweet by someone who works in deception, or (b) an actual, incredible, personalised, glowing endorsement by the US President, plenty of people are ready to believe (b).
@LaraWarmelink I should be clearer - the words in the screen caps won‚Äôt come up in searches. You‚Äôll note in my tweets themselves I‚Äôve been careful not to use names, and I‚Äôd say your caution is well-placed and wise.
@bgzimmer He‚Äôs so culturally thoughtful, you know? Always willing to accommodate the customs and languages of other countries. A diplomat‚Äôs diplomat.üò∂
@LaraWarmelink Right? It‚Äôs tough to be this influential. I write about handling the pressures of fame in my forthcoming memoirs: Bezzies With The Prezzies.
@LaraWarmelink Not a single one, so far, but then it wouldn‚Äôt show up in any searches for Trump. (Another reason why these sorts of fake tweets are so hard to find and stop.)
But it‚Äôs okay if you can‚Äôt help but feel it, personally, because your work was made by you, after all, and divorcing yourself from that personal investment is really hard, and it takes time and practice. For most of us, criticism will *always* sting. https://t.co/CLBePfSpUv
Seriously, though, why are the past two US presidents tweeting me? Because it takes about three minutes to create a convincing fake tweet. If you see a screen-cap of a wildly unbelievable tweet, the clue is in "wildly unbelievable".  As the Pope and Putin will shortly confirm.
Gosh would you just look at that. Two presidents tweeting me in the same day. It's almost unbelievable, https://t.co/bbpPT6WpKc
@LaraWarmelink Elon Musk hasn‚Äôt tweeted me yet, so sadly, it‚Äôs all a bit pedestrian.

@ShlomoArgamon @JWGrieve @bgzimmer @nationalpost @juola Yeah, the write-up of that fudges the distinction slightly. The conclusion in my blog post is more-or-less word-for-word what I sent to the journalist.
@ShlomoArgamon @JWGrieve @bgzimmer @nationalpost @juola If ‚Äúwork‚Äù = ‚Äúconclusively identify someone‚Äù then I don‚Äôt think any of us would ever argue that.

@ShlomoArgamon @JWGrieve @bgzimmer @nationalpost @juola Not trying to be awkward but is there a substantive difference between those two positions? (I am very sleep deprived.) Whatever the case, my view here is that you would have to take any FL results with even more caution than usual due to all the extra issues around this case.

Plenty of supporters argued several of these. Some even put forward apparently contradictory rationales *in the same tweet* (e.g. 2 and 7 together was surprisingly common).  So there you go. How to keep your red cap pulled down tight even when the political winds blow. 6/6
The would/wouldn‚Äôt flip-flop is fine because‚Ä¶  6. ‚Ä¶all countries and leaders do this kind of thing, and we shouldn‚Äôt hold Trump to a different standard.  7. ‚Ä¶Trump admitted he was wrong and that takes character, and therefore shows what an excellent president he is. 5/76
The would/wouldn‚Äôt flip-flop is fine because‚Ä¶  4. ‚Ä¶Trump was given faulty intel by his team which he then later had to correct, so this wasn‚Äôt actually his fault.  5. ‚Ä¶Trump does other things right, so we should focus on the good and overlook issues like this. 4/6
The would/wouldn‚Äôt flip-flop is fine because‚Ä¶  2. ‚Ä¶Trump has a grand strategy; this calculated appeasement meant he could focus on other issues.  3. ‚Ä¶Trump is reducing US enemies, and not embarrassing Putin live in front of a world audience avoids a diplomatic crisis. 3/6
A VERY quick analysis of ~2,500 Trump-supporter tweets revealed *at least* seven ways of framing Trump‚Äôs behaviour as rational and even admirable. These are thus:  The would/wouldn‚Äôt flip-flop is fine because‚Ä¶  1. ‚Ä¶Trump is keeping his friends close and his enemies closer. 2/6
It might seem obvious that switching from WOULD to WOULDN‚ÄôT is presidentially problematic, and yet, to the surprise of many, Trump supporters seem entirely unfazed by this u-turn. How can this be? Well, it‚Äôs actually pretty easy to rationalise someone‚Äôs behaviour from afar. 1/6

Oh. Er. How long is the break?
@Karrie_Don @jenxhughes We‚Äôve hypothesised that they‚Äôve used ballet/tap-dancing glue to hold their socks in place on the knees.
Alli‚Äôs sock glue has worn out.
@Karrie_Don Ah, god yes of course.
Is all this aimless kicking about the football equivalent of stuffing their essay to make the word count‚Ä¶?
Literally no clue what‚Äôs going on right now.
Blimey‚Ä¶  There‚Äôs booing??
See now that was like a really big crash and no one cried or rolled around.  Also one of those England guys is really fast.  Oh my god does the clock stop every time the ball goes off the pitch??? Jesus. No wonder this tournament has been going on for fifty two years.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want to be in the goal. üòï
I love the guy stood next to Gareth Southgate who looks like Dave who came to fix the tap but he can‚Äôt get to his van till everyone‚Äôs off the pitch and he‚Äôs bored to tears with it all and just wants his Greggs.
I dunno, that looked a lot like showboating. Are there on-the-pitch etiquette guides about stuff like that?
@jenxhughes Knee glue. I can get behind that.
This is so weird. I just saw two of them crash into each other - hard - and dust themselves off and carry on, but then the one who scored the goal earlier had a little bump and fell down like he‚Äôd been shot in the leg?
So Roger Federer is managing Croatia‚Äôs team?
@bryancsk I must have missed that whilst my TV reloaded.  Oh!  I think I just got ‚ÄúIN GER LERND!‚Äù Or maybe ‚Äúin the net‚Äù???
Thoughts on actual time spent playing:  70% - ball‚Äôs off the pitch miles away somewhere  20% - people waving their arms about gesturing wildly  8% - slow motion replays of this one guy‚Äôs foot brushing this other guy‚Äôs shin and the crowd howling  2% - chasing the football around
Thoughts on clothes: There‚Äôs someone wearing Croatia colours backwards.  Also I like how high the England knee-socks are but I don‚Äôt understand how they keep them up right over the curve of the knee? Maybe it‚Äôs a special dress tape like you get with ballgowns?
OH! A Trippier is a person!
People wave their hands about a lot for a game that‚Äôs very foot-oriented.  Not sure if I‚Äôm finding the adverts or the singing more distracting. One is too visible, the other is hard to make out properly.
TV is telling me it was a trippier goal. Can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs a technique or a brand or what.  And why does that one guy in white have yellow shoes on?
WAIT I have it, except the signal is a bit rubbish.  Huh.  Not gonna lie.  Croatia‚Äôs kit is cooler than ours.  Also people seem really shouty.
So here I am, trying to watch football for the first time in my life, almost unironically too, and it turns out this TV doesn‚Äôt receive ITV‚Ä¶?  Currently reloading channels, but I can‚Äôt help feeling like this is a sign.

@f_frontini Interesting question: the first thing I have to say is that I‚Äôm not sure, but when you go back to the earlier personal account tweets, the style is *very* different and some things occur that could be NNS errors. I‚Äôd have to look properly again though to be more sure.

5/5 Final thought for those who remain unconvinced: on your deathbed you will not think, "I wish I'd done more admin reports." You'll think, "I wish I'd cuddled my babies more/walked in the hills more/had fun more."  Get cuddling and walking and funning, people. https://t.co/p4z74RHjFO
4/5 That you're working too many hours (alright you probably knew this but now you know by how much) and that you NEED to address the underlying issue, be it workload, institutional culture, or whatever. Do this for your emotional, physical, and mental wellbeing.
3/5  3. SCHEDULE REGULAR BREAKS. Stop the guilt before it even starts.  4. BLOCK OUT ALL NON-WORK TIME. And never touch it. Ever. EVER.  5. OBEY YOUR NEW TINY DICTATOR.  But what if your to-do list regularly won't fit into your available hours? Then you've learned two things...
2/5 RULES:  1. DO NOT SCHEDULE OUTSIDE OF REASONABLE WORKING HOURS. If you consistently work long hours, you disadvantages us ALL, yourself included.  2. GIVE GENEROUS TIME ALLOWANCES. Twice what you think you'll need. Create regular chances for success, not many ways to fail.
1/5 Another academic "trick" for managing workloads:  1) get a to-do list app (e.g. @todoist)  2) get a calendar/diary - paper, online, whatever  3) schedule your to-do items into your calendar, e.g. - 900-1200: TODO marking - 1200-1300: lunch - 1300-1400: TODO reference

@tkingdot It would also be costly and messy for shop databases to have possibly dozens of barcodes all for the same product. The more I ponder this, the less I think it has anything to do with the barcode itself and maybe it‚Äôs just a means of entering you into the right competition.
@tkingdot I am not for one second suggesting that you should start working your way around the various local supermarkets, checking literally every barcode till you find a different one.

@joelhenghartse The trouble is, without your reference corpus, it‚Äôs harder to make sense of the relationship of your deer:fox ratio in your own corpus because you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.  Hoping that all makes sense and is new information, not stuff you already knew! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
@joelhenghartse I have a 10 acre wildlife enclosure (my corpus). It contains 100 deer and 5 foxes. Is that difference meaningful? I inspect 1,000 acres in the countryside (reference corpus). I find 10,000 deer and 5 foxes. It seems I have an unusually high concentration of foxes in my corpus.
@joelhenghartse ‚Ä¶e.g. to tell whether something is occurring unusually (in)frequently it‚Äôs useful to compare your corpus to a reference corpus. Then you get a better sense of how often your phrases occur ‚Äúin the wild‚Äù and how they‚Äôre behaving in your particular dataset. A terrible example: ‚Ä¶
@joelhenghartse Hi Joel, comparing the frequency of two different phenomena in a corpus usually tells you a limited amount. e.g. If ‚Äúa‚Äù occurs 10 times in my corpus,and ‚Äúthe‚Äù occurs 15 times, the difference isn‚Äôt inherently remarkable because they do different jobs. For deeper insight‚Ä¶

Well, this morning‚Äôs run was a bit magical. Started at @LancasterUni campus and headed up into the frosty hills. The golden sunlight was lighting up the silvery freezing mist in the valleys. Pity my phone couldn‚Äôt capture it well but the last pic gives you an idea. https://t.co/i1lM6o2EFE

Lots of proper first names are also words. Some names have awesome alternative ‚Äúreal‚Äù meanings. For instance, an andrew is a broadsword, a gentleman‚Äôs valet, and a warship. A stella is ‚Äùa star-shaped projection on the surface of a coralline‚Äù. (OED)
@frazzleddad I do now. Regularly refer to it as ‚ÄúMy Hill‚Äù as I do most of my running and riding round it.  Apparently I have a hill-owning complex.  I‚Äôll be up in view of it again this morning. If weather permits I‚Äôll try to get a nice pic for you.

For an introvert with OCD, there is no satisfaction quite like spending two hours tearing apart a room, chucking out all the crap, cleaning everything else, and putting it all back together better than before. It‚Äôs my once-weekly therapy session.  Yep.  I really am that hip.
It‚Äôs quite sad how excited I am about running again tomorrow. Truthfully the cold hasn‚Äôt yet gone but I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôd rather stagger through rain and get my reward-cake than stay in and starve.

Pendle Hill is a nice one. Pen predates the Roman invasion and means hill. By C7th when that meaning was forgotten, Hyll was added. By C13th Pen Hyll had become Penhul, and by C15th Penhul was Pendle, so of course, Hill was added. Again. So Pendle Hill is actually Hill Hill Hill. https://t.co/Wvd71RKBfV

And you can reread this thread with appropriate antonyms/substitutions to explain how privilege/wealth works in almost exactly the same way. ‚ÄúWhen you have lots of money, you can afford to buy in bulk‚Ä¶‚Äù etc.  A bit like a ‚Äúchoose your own socioeconomic adventure‚Äù thread.
11/11 And so they too are likely to only be able to get the lower paying jobs, meaning they can only afford the cheapest rent in the worst areas, where their children will go to the lowest performing schools with the dimmest prospects, and so on‚Ä¶ END
10/11 Your child‚Äôs subpar education also means that they struggle to compete for jobs, and even if they could get a uni place, you have no money to help them with fees, or give them driving lessons, or provide a house deposit. If they get uni loans, they start life in huge debt.
9/11 Meanwhile your kids go out and kill time on street corners because there is literally nothing else for them to do, and from there they start to get into trouble. Having little themselves, the temptation to take from others who have more is that much greater.
8/11 Your children have to go to local schools which are more likely to be poorly funded and under-performing, and you can‚Äôt afford extra-curricular activities like swimming or ballet or even dining out so you stay in and watch TV (oh, the poor and their lavish colour TVs).
7/11 You can't afford the healthy, organic, fresh food, never mind the cost of the gas/electric that it would take to cook it, because a single pack of avocados is the same price as a cheap ready-made pizza that will feed four and oven-bake in fifteen minutes.
6/11 Banks won't authorise much/any overdraft because of your low income, so when you go overdrawn, you‚Äôre mired in fines. If those defaults force you to borrow, they will also mean that you can't get reputable, low-interest loans, leaving you with payday, or worse, skin loans.
5/11 But you can't accept overtime because the one-off increase in your pay means that you'll lose your benefits for weeks until the amounts are recalculated to the government‚Äôs satisfaction, so accepting cash-in-hand jobs becomes tempting.
4/11 You can't buy a newer car unless it‚Äôs on credit (if you can get credit) with interest, whilst older ones use more fuel and need fixing more often. The only affordable rent is in crime-ridden areas, so insurance for your house/car costs a fortune, if you can even afford it.
3/11 You end up on pre-pay meters that charge higher gas and electric tariffs. Even if it‚Äôs not pre-pay, you have to pay these bigger bills in more installments over longer time-periods, which carry higher rates of interest.
2/11 When you have no money, you have to buy the smallest sizes, which cost the most per kilo or litre. You have to rent the shittiest housing (if landlords will even rent to you) with drafts/damp/mould so your heating has to be on more.
1/11 Why do I get fed-up of the Haves telling the Have-nots (looking at some of you MPs right now) that their financial struggles are entirely their own fault? In case anyone cares particularly, this thread tries to explain‚Ä¶ https://t.co/WB8wjKdgiR

@nik_dey Oh cripes... Nil points for comprehension skills to me. I stand by the general principle though. Plenty of people don't earn anything like ¬£35k, even in London, and won't get help from family. And plenty aren't in a relationship so have no chance. :-/

Ever wondered what a bot impersonating your language looks like? A post about cloning myself in code: https://t.co/IfMrXYasrq @PyClaireH
Quick update - @DrClaireH2 is now @PyClaireH. Honestly, hours of thinking and it's the best handle I could come up with. :-/
@AThrysoee @DrClaireH2 Oooh, she;s behaving herself admirably. The "one response only" bit of code appears to be working. Phew!
@DrClaireH2 @AThrysoee Ha! Man, I love her already. :-)
@AThrysoee Try a direct tweet to @DrClaireH2. See if she plays ball. (Fingers crossed she isn't saving up a torrent of responses!)
@AThrysoee It can find strings and then create a response based on keywords within that tweet too but that's not enabled yet. @DrClaireH2
@AThrysoee In theory, @DrClaireH2 should respond to you once, or at most, twice. I'm watching to see how (if?!) that works properly though.
@DrClaireH2 I'm talking... to... myself. Only this feels somewhat legitimate for a change.
@DrClaireH2 Hello lovely bot. This is a test. How are you doing this evening?
I'll be blogging about the @DrClaireH2 bot soon from a corpus linguistics, authorship analysis, and amateur-coding nerd perspective.
Important news: I have cloned myself in Python code. Python-me is slightly delirious, but fun. Follow me/her here: @DrClaireH2.

The "get un-fat" app has noticed that I'm "running" a mile in around 20 minutes. It's valiantly recommending protein, blogs, and friends.

In my defence the "get un-fat" app doesn't have a "shambling across the road in the face of oncoming traffic whilst live-tweeting" option.
Have just told my "get un-fat" app that I'm running when I am, in fact, only walking. Slowly.  Starting to feel morally bankrupt.

Our immense thanks to @DanutaJR for giving a splendid talk on crime writing, and staying to dinner too. Gripping stuff on a bleak evening!
.@DanutaJR talks about how she finds out about her characters. "I need to write a story to give them a stage to walk around on."
Q: "Have you ever had a book that you didn't finish?" A: "Sometimes they do come to a dead halt but all finished so far." - @DanutaJR
"I do like to go to places that I write about, and that's the most demanding, but people are amazingly helpful with writers." - @DanutaJR
"Police are very cooperative; they like crime writers. They took me to a crime scene and offered to take me to a post mortem." - @DanutaJR
.@DanutaJR is reading an excerpt from The Last Room. Not going to lie. Have goosebumps. https://t.co/rBwC3tZB3j
.@DanutaJR is reading an excerpt from The Last Room. Can't tweet. Too busy listening.
"I wanted the forensic linguist, Ania Milosz to be at the centre of the book, The Last Room, but she wouldn't write." - @DanutaJR
"It wasn't till my sixth book, The Last Room, that forensic linguistics managed to play a part." - @DanutaJR
I'm forgetting to tweet. Too busy listening.
"Suppose a note arrives in your letterbox saying "Look at that!" It's hard to work out its meaning. It's strange and sinister." - @DanutaJR
.@DanutaJR is reading an excerpt from one of her novels. Am very tempted to ask her to just read out the rest of her novel after the talk!
"We have vestigial remains of ceremonies around the danger of thresholds - lucky charms over doorways, bridal veils." - @DanutaJR
"I thought it would be hard to write like a serial killer, but I found my inner serial-killer frighteningly easy to locate!" - @DanutaJR
"I did a degree in linguistics and discovered that language can be used as much to elucidate as to obfuscate." - @DanutaJR
"When writing, you have to think about people, places, and a plot, and see if forensic linguistics has any place in the story." - @DanutaJR
"But Bentley's statement was not a verbatim statement. It was a write-up of a question and answer interview." - @DanutaJR
"In his summing up, the judge said that if Bentley had not known about the gun, he would have said "A gun", not "THE gun"." - @DanutaJR
"Negation is a powerful form of emphasis. Look at the start of Emma or what Scout says about her dad in To Kill a Mockingbird." - @DanutaJR
.@DanutaJR tells us that we're not allowed to think about hippos for the next ten seconds. I think most of us failed!
"The rules of evidence were far looser than they are now. And Bentley was convicted on the strength of his statement." - @DanutaJR
"Another case that interests me is the miscarriage of justice in the Derek Bentley case. In 1953 Bentley was hanged for murder." - @DanutaJR
"In the Peter Sutcliffe case, the linguists said that the tape and letters were fake. But the police would not accept that." - @DanutaJR
"Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe was arrested five minutes from where I live, and the woman he was with was someone I knew." - @DanutaJR
"Your language can reveal an awful lot about you. Your immediate circumstances, how you're feeling, but also more generally." - @DanutaJR
"It's an interesting, rather disorganised life but I can't imagine ever stopping. The minute I didn't enjoy writing, I'd stop." - @DanutaJR
"Sometimes I'm getting quite near the end of the book and I still don't quite know who did it!" - @DanutaJR
"I met a world of people and had many experiences. When I got a sense of myself, I went to university and found my own voice." - @DanutaJR
"I've done just about every low-expertise job in the world, and that probably gave me brilliant training for being a writer." - @DanutaJR
Talk by @DanutaJR underway: "If you want to be a writer, you can't just follow a certain path. All writers have different pasts."
Apparently if you think Never Say Never Again was a real Bond film, you get your TV Licence revoked.  I didn't know. I'M SORRY.  #SPECTRE

TODAY'S @FORGE_LU talk at 1500: Prof @timgrant123 - Tracking the multiple linguistic identities of online paedophiles http://t.co/FNwYqFIA1X
Just spilled a whole travel-mug of very nice, strong, expensive coffee in my car's footwell.  Not sure what the point of 2015 is anymore.
A: What's that game called that they all play these days? Full Metal Gears of Warcraft?  Me: ‚Ä¶ Sure. Why not.
A: He did it by the skin of his pants.  Me: Do you hate metaphors?  A: I don't care about his lifestyle. I care that he's rubbish.  Me: ...
Quick chat this morning with @NickFerrariLBC about Prof Paul Iganski's (@H8hurts) work into online abuse in the APPG anti-Semitism report.
I'll be on @BBCEssex through the afternoon talking about trolling, free speech, and the difficulty of dealing with online abuse.
@tescomobilecare Go on then, as it's a Friday afternoon.
@WatchedPotts Note to self: Potts is a most plausible Twitter fabulist.
@tescomobilecare It's in and working, though now waiting on phone restoring from cloud. Compensatory Jaffa Cakes for my day of missed work?
@WatchedPotts Had you not said you were kidding, I would've smugly whipped these "facts" out one day during an awkward dinner party silence.
@tescomobilecare Hallo, I phoned for a new SIM Wed afternoon, and you deactivated my old one Thu night. New SIM just got here an hour ago. üòñ
Any media queries today, please go through email, since @tescomobile kindly deactivated my old SIM before they got my new one to me.
Remember that time when lists came in multiples of fives? Like "Ten tips for a top CV." When did it get all, "91.7 pictures of funny toast"?

We got upgraded at our hotel again?! It's not officially a penthouse suite, which makes me wonder what the actual penthouse suites are like.
I just want my own brand new, lightweight, super-fast, software-already-installed, WinXP laptop. For free. Is that really so much to ask??
And then Toshiba said, "Lo, I shall put all the jacks on the laptop's front right, so that the mouse constantly hits cables and pendrives."
"Applying updates. Please wait."  Meanwhile, the latest revolution in computing and the next ice age have passed already.
I'll be on @bbc5live in just under an hour, looking back at the big stories of 2014, and discussing online abuse in particular.
Will 2015 be the year of the trolled? A bit by me in @OllyRicketts' @contributoria article. https://t.co/gEo2TEqnK0 http://t.co/7swm7Atc8h
@antlabjp It's not a metaphor (or paranoia) if it's true. üòâ
"Turn over a few pebbles each day, and at the end of a lifetime, you will have moved a mountain." ‚Äî Me, today, after too much wine.
It's nearly here! Merry Christmas all, and to all, a good night. http://t.co/teEHAekM1D
My Christmas Eve @weetabix seems to have been made with‚Ä¶ I dunno‚Ä¶ tissue in it?? üò´ http://t.co/r72h9z8CEl
@perayson YES. Stop working, for pity's sake!
"I wish webpages featured more pop-ups, redirects to the App Store, and autoplay adverts." ‚Äî No one, ever.
@WrightDW Congratulations Dr Wright!!
When your to-do list gets so long that you start cleaning the desk, rearranging your books, picking fluff out of the keyboard...
Just had a lovely interview on @BBCLancashire for @GrahamLiver's breakfast show about the most popular Google search terms of 2014.

@GarethHumphre11 @HardieResearch Partly, but that's specifically for physicians, and the nil nocere part doesn't seem to capture inaction.
@HardieResearch First Law of Humanity. Still working on the Second and Third.
By no act or omission should you knowingly cause or allow harm if you can reasonably prevent it.

@VeronikaKoller I think we're somewhere near Mayfair? My photos are being variously geotagged with "Bloomsbury" and "West End".
So far this morning, three Nespresso flavours tried. Three to go.  #twitch
