When spidering or just downloading a list of webpage URLs (e.g. with curl or requests), it will be left with a collection of HTML files. These raw HTML files contain a lot of redundant information (e.g. adverts, menus, headings, etc.), this is known as "boilerplate". What we want is the main text of the webpage only (i.e. the news article, the blog post, etc.), in plain text without the HTML tags
