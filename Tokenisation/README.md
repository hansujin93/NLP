The aim of tokenisation is to separate the text into meaningful components that are useful for future analysis (e.g. counting or annotating). 
Often the most logical token is a "word" (e.g. for "bag-of-words" based methods), but deciding what constitutes a word is not straight-forward. 
At other times, punctuation should be maintained (e.g. for part of speech annotation).
