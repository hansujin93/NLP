Preprocessing is often understated in its importance for any data analysis task, especially when dealing with textual data. 
Ensuring that the data that you are analysing is consistent, has expected characteristics (i.e. what is actually present), and will be processed as expected by future stages of the analysis is essential.
It cannot be emphasised enough the value in actually examining samples of the data to see what is present. 
This can save a lot of work later on when you get nasty surprises when your analysis falls over, or you get unexpected results which you cannot explain (or, worse still, you're not aware of the noise propagating through your system).
