Use the MPs data provided to conduct some further feature extraction and analysis. Write code to answer the following questions:
* Which MP in the dataset has the highest average token length?
* What are the 5 key part-of-speech tags overused by Labour MPs compared to Conservative MPs?
* What hashtags does Jeremy Corbyn use frequently, which aren't used widely by the rest of the Labour party MPs in the dataset (TF-IDF)?
